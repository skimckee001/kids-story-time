- **Cost**: $20,000-40,000
- **Pros**:
  - Share 70% of code
  - Native performance
  - Full device features
  - App store presence
- **Cons**:
  - Significant development effort
  - Ongoing maintenance
  - App store fees (30%)
  - Review process delays

#### Option 3: Capacitor/Ionic

## üîß Technical Improvements

### Story Generation Optimization
```javascript
// Enhanced prompt engineering
const generateStory = async (params) => {
  const { age, name, theme, elements, readingLevel, interests } = params;
  
  const agePrompts = {
    '3-6': 'simple sentences, repetition, clear moral, 500 words',
    '7-9': 'chapter structure, dialogue, plot twists, 1000 words',
    '10-12': 'complex plot, character development, cliffhangers, 1500 words'
  };
  
  const prompt = `
    Create a ${theme} story for ${name}, age ${age}.
    Style: ${agePrompts[ageRange]}
    Include: ${elements.join(', ')}
    Interests: ${interests.join(', ')}
    Similar to: ${popularBooks[ageRange].join(', ')}
    Avoid: scary content, inappropriate themes
    Format: Engaging, age-appropriate, educational
  `;
  
  return await openai.createCompletion(prompt);
};
```

### Rewards System Clarification

    <h3>‚≠ê Star Shop</h3>
    <p>Spend stars on rewards</p>
    <button>Shop Now ({stars} stars)</button>
  </div>
  
  <div className="achievement-section">
    <h3>üèÜ Achievements</h3>
