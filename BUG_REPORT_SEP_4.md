# Bug Report - September 4, 2025
## User Testing of Pro Plan ($4.99)

### Main App Page
- [ ] Your plan usage: get a better icon
- [ ] Replace "undefined" with 0 in usage display
- [ ] Upgrade button shows wrong tier - should say "Read to Me Pro-Max" when in Story Pro
- [ ] Create new profile should go directly to setup page (bypass menu)
- [ ] Clicking profile name should open profiles list
- [ ] Label should be "Child's name (or character story is about)"
- [ ] Pro tier still gives cartoon/free illustration only
- [ ] Says "reader free" at bottom (should be Story Pro)

### Create New Profile (Popout)
- [ ] Stories favour gender field placement
- [ ] "Include child's name" needs to move up under child's name field
- [ ] Change "Favourite things" to "Favourite story topics"
- [ ] Add button should auto-save and be part of Create Profile action
- [ ] Profile button (top left menu) doesn't work

### Story Generation Page

- [ ] Star Reward Shop doesn't work - profile switching issue
- [ ] Library title should show "Profile 1: [Name]" not just "1 profile"
- [ ] Footer copyright is white on white
- [ ] Library link takes user to home page instead of library

### Star Rewards Shop Popout
- [ ] Put "My Rewards" first and "All" last

### Badges Popout
- [ ] Fix colors - remove green, use light purple background with purple border

- [ ] Add whitespace between header and tabs

### Library Page
- [ ] Story title and image not saving/displaying
