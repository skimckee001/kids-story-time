## Technical Changes Made

### Files Modified
1. **src/components/Header.jsx** - Standardized header with More menu
2. **src/components/StoryDisplay.jsx** - Added ReadingStreak, fixed layout
3. **src/components/StoryLibrary.jsx** - Complete restructure with Header component
4. **src/components/AchievementSystem.jsx** - Added Reading Goals section

### Key Code Patterns Established
```javascript
// Standard Header usage across all pages
<Header 
  user={user}
  subscriptionTier={subscriptionTier}
  starPoints={starPoints}
  onShowLibrary={handleLibrary}
  onShowAuth={handleAuth}
  onShowAchievements={handleAchievements}
  onShowRewards={handleRewards}
  onLogoClick={handleHome}
/>

// Consistent page structure
<div className="page-wrapper">
  <Header />
  <ReadingStreak childProfile={profile} />
  <div className="content">
    {/* Page specific content */}
  </div>
</div>
```

## Known Issues & Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Image Generation**: 
   - Console shows image generation working but images may not display
   - Need to verify image URLs are valid and accessible
   - Check if API keys are properly configured in production

2. **Subscription Tier Mapping**:
   - Ensure 'basic' maps to 'Story Maker' tier
   - Ensure 'plus' maps to 'Family' tier
   - Verify tier names consistency across the app

3. **Ad Display**:
   - Ads should show for 'try-now' and 'reader' tiers
   - Verify AdSense configuration
   - Check ad placement in story view

### Future Enhancements
1. **Profile Management**:
   - Add profile switching in header
   - Show active child profile indicator
   - Per-child achievement tracking

2. **Pricing Integration**:
   - Connect pricing page to Stripe checkout
   - Implement subscription management
   - Add payment method updates

3. **Performance**:
   - Bundle size optimization (currently 690KB)
   - Implement code splitting
   - Lazy load heavy components

4. **Testing Needed**:
   - Test all tier limits (story generation, AI features)
   - Verify upgrade flows for each tier
   - Test achievement unlocking
   - Validate streak tracking accuracy
