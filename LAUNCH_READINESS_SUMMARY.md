## üö® STILL NEEDS ATTENTION (Before Launch)

### 1. Database Setup ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL
**Action Required**: Run the SQL migration to create `user_usage` table
```sql
-- Execute this in your Supabase SQL editor:
-- Content from /database/migrations/001_add_user_usage_table.sql
```

### 2. Stripe Payment Testing üî¥ HIGH PRIORITY
**What to Test**:
- [ ] Verify price IDs exist in Stripe dashboard
- [ ] Test checkout flow with test cards
- [ ] Verify webhook endpoints receive events
- [ ] Test subscription tier updates after payment
- [ ] Test upgrade/downgrade flows

**Test Cards**:
- Success: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
- Decline: `4000 0000 0000 0002`
- Insufficient funds: `4000 0000 0000 9995`

### 3. Environment Variables üî¥ HIGH PRIORITY
**Verify these are set in production**:
```bash
‚úÖ VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_production_url
‚úÖ VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_production_key
‚úÖ VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
‚ö†Ô∏è VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_... (NOT test key)
‚ö†Ô∏è STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_... (server-side)
‚ö†Ô∏è STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_... (webhook secret)
```

### 4. Mobile Testing üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY
**Test on actual devices**:
- [ ] iPhone SE (4.7"), iPhone 12 Mini (5.4")
- [ ] iPhone 14 Pro (6.1"), iPhone 16 Pro Max (6.9")
- [ ] Test touch interactions and modal displays
- [ ] Verify orientation changes work properly
