# Session Summary - December 21, 2024

## Project Status
**App Status**: ✅ Fully functional and deployed to production
**URL**: https://kidsstorytime.org
**Tech Stack**: React 18 + Vite, Netlify deployment, Supabase backend

## Work Completed Today

### 1. Enhanced Read Aloud Functionality ✅
- Redesigned with separate control panel that slides down
- Added voice selection dropdown with system voices
- Implemented Play/Pause/Stop controls
- Added speed controls (Slow 0.7x, Normal 0.9x, Fast 1.2x)
- Better error handling and fallback to default voice
- Mobile responsive design

### 2. Fixed Advertising Integration ✅
- Added Google AdSense component
- Placed ads mid-story for free tier users
- Reduced ad height from 250px to 90px minimum
- Note: AdSense ID "ca-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX" needs real account

### 3. Updated Home Page Text ✅
- Changed tagline to "Personalized stories and illustrations for your child"
- Made checkbox label normal weight (not bold)
- Changed placeholder to "The more elaborate the better..."

### 4. Fixed Image Button for Free Users ✅
- Non-logged users: "Register (free forever) to add an image" - clicks to auth modal
- Logged-in free users: "Upgrade to add AI images" with tooltip
- Fixed tooltip positioning to prevent right-side cutoff
- Added responsive mobile positioning

### 5. Documentation Updates ✅
- Created comprehensive README.md
- Added detailed FEATURES.md
- Updated package.json description
- DEPLOYMENT_ISSUES.md already current

## Known Issues/Notes

### Non-Issues (Safe to Ignore)
- `web-client-content-script.js` errors are from browser extensions, not your app
- AdSense 400 errors are because placeholder ID is used

### Deployment Notes
- MIME type issues are documented in DEPLOYMENT_ISSUES.md
- Always check netlify.toml has proper headers for /assets/*.js
- If white screen occurs, clear Netlify cache and redeploy
