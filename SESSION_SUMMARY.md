## Known Issues/Notes

### Non-Issues (Safe to Ignore)
- `web-client-content-script.js` errors are from browser extensions, not your app
- AdSense 400 errors are because placeholder ID is used

### Deployment Notes
- MIME type issues are documented in DEPLOYMENT_ISSUES.md
- Always check netlify.toml has proper headers for /assets/*.js
- If white screen occurs, clear Netlify cache and redeploy
