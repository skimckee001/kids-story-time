## üî¥ Current Issues Being Investigated

### iPhone Blank Screen Problem

- **Browser Console:** Shows `web-client-content-script.js` error (from extension, not our code)
- **Attempted Fixes:**
  1. Removed webkit-mask-image from all elements (can cause iOS rendering issues)
  2. Added ErrorBoundary to catch and display React errors
  3. Set Vite build target to ES2015
  4. Added error logging throughout initialization

### Library Not Saving Story Data
- Debug logging added but needs testing in production
- Check console for "Saving story to library with data:" messages

### Still Need to Fix:
1. **Navigation & Layout Issues**

   - Star Rewards System tab ordering (changed to show "My Rewards" first)

2. **Story Library Issues**
   - Story title and image still not saving/displaying properly (logging added, needs testing)
   - Need to verify library button now works in production

3. **Testing Required**
