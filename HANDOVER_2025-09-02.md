### First Thing Tomorrow
1. Check if landing page is live at https://www.kidsstorytime.ai/landing.html
2. Verify A/B testing analytics are capturing data
3. Begin implementing story templates feature

## 📋 Tomorrow's Priority Tasks

### 1. Story Templates (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Location**: `/src/App.complete.jsx`
**What to build**:
- Template selection UI before story generation
- 20+ pre-made story starters like:
  - "A magical door appears in your bedroom..."
  - "You discover you can talk to animals..."
  - "You find a treasure map in your backyard..."
- Categories: Adventure, Fantasy, Mystery, Friendship, etc.
- Age-appropriate filtering

### 2. Character Library
**Location**: New component `/src/components/CharacterLibrary.jsx`
**What to build**:
- Save character feature in StoryDisplay
- Character management page
- Reuse characters in new stories
- Character relationship tracking

### 3. Export Features
**Location**: `/src/components/StoryDisplay.jsx`
**What to build**:
- PDF download button
- Audio file export (MP3)
- Print-friendly CSS
- Batch export for library

### 4. Payment Testing
**CRITICAL**: Test before any marketing push
- Use Stripe test cards
- Verify webhook at `/netlify/functions/stripe-webhook.js`
- Test all three tiers
- Confirm subscription changes work

## 🔍 Key Files to Work With

### Main Application Files
```

```

### New Files Created Today

## 🐛 Known Issues to Address

1. **Landing Page A/B Testing**: Need to set up proper analytics tracking

3. **Mobile Performance**: Check landing page on small devices
4. **Star Rewards**: Monitor if users understand the system

## 💡 Important Context

### Competitor Features We're Missing
From analyzing StoryTimeAI, these are the top features to implement:
1. **Story Templates** - Pre-made starters (Tomorrow's #1 priority)
2. **Character Library** - Reusable characters (Tomorrow's #2 priority)
3. **Voice Selection** - Multiple narrator options
4. **Background Music** - Ambient sounds
5. **Choose Your Adventure** - Interactive paths
6. **Story Collections** - Themed bundles

### Age Group Strategy

  - Harry Potter/Hunger Games style content

### Marketing Insights
