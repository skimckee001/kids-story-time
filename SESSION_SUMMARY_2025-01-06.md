# Session Summary - January 6, 2025

## Session Overview
Fixed critical image display issues in the library and resolved production deployment problems. The app is now fully deployed with working features except for story generation which needs API keys configured in Netlify.

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed Today

### 1. Library Card Images Not Displaying
**Problem:** Library cards showed gradient backgrounds instead of actual story images
**Root Cause:** 
- StoryCard component only checked for `image_url` but mock generator saved as `imageUrl` (camelCase)
- Placeholder service URLs (`via.placeholder.com`) were failing with DNS errors

**Solution:**
- Updated StoryCard to handle both `image_url` and `imageUrl` properties
- Replaced broken placeholder.com URLs with reliable Picsum photos service
- Added fallback SVG image generation for when external images fail
- Created property normalization when loading/saving stories

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/StoryLibrary.jsx` - Handle both image property formats
- `src/utils/mockStoryGenerator.js` - Use Picsum instead of placeholder.com
- `src/utils/fallbackImage.js` - New fallback image generator
- `src/App.complete.jsx` - Ensure both image formats saved

### 2. Production Deployment Issues
**Problem:** Story generation failing with 502 errors in production
**Root Cause:** Missing environment variables in Netlify (especially OpenAI API key)

**Solution:**
- Linked local repository to Netlify site
- Created diagnostic function (`check-env.js`) to verify environment variables
- Fixed CSP (Content Security Policy) to allow Google Analytics and AdSense
- Successfully deployed all fixes to production

### 3. Git Repository Sync
**Verified:** Local and GitHub repositories are fully synced
**Deployment:** Manual deployment to Netlify working correctly

## üöÄ Production Status

### Working Features ‚úÖ
- App loads correctly at https://www.kidsstorytime.ai
- Dev mode (`?dev=true`) shows purple tier testing button
- Library displays with proper images (using Picsum photos)
- Profile switching and tier testing functional
- Navigation between pages working
- CSP updated to allow Google Analytics and AdSense

### Not Working ‚ùå
- **Story Generation** - Returns 502 errors due to missing API keys
- **Automatic Deployment** - Needs GitHub webhook configuration in Netlify

## üîß Required Actions (For User)

### 1. Add Environment Variables to Netlify
Go to https://app.netlify.com > Your Site > Site configuration > Environment variables

**Required for Story Generation:**
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-[your-key]
SUPABASE_URL=[your-supabase-url]
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[your-anon-key]
```

**Optional but Recommended:**
```
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_[your-key]
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_[your-key]
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=[same-as-OPENAI_API_KEY]
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=[same-as-SUPABASE_URL]
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[same-as-SUPABASE_ANON_KEY]
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_[your-key]
```

### 2. Set Up Automatic Deployment
1. In Netlify Dashboard > Site settings > Build & deploy
2. Link to GitHub repository: `skimckee001/kids-story-time`
3. Set branch to deploy from: `main`
4. Enable auto-deploy on push

### 3. Verify Environment Configuration
Visit: https://www.kidsstorytime.ai/.netlify/functions/check-env
This will show which environment variables are configured (without revealing values)

## üìù Code Quality Improvements Made

### Mock Story Generator
- Now uses deterministic image selection for consistency
- Replaced unreliable placeholder services with Picsum photos
- Added proper fallback handling with SVG generation

### Image Handling
- Normalized property naming (handles both snake_case and camelCase)
- Added comprehensive error handling and fallbacks
- Improved debugging with detailed console logs

### Development Tools
- Created `debug-image-flow.js` for troubleshooting
- Created `clear-broken-stories.js` for cleanup
- Created `test-image-fix.js` for verification
- Added `check-env.js` function for environment diagnostics

## üéØ Next Session Priorities

1. **Verify API Keys** - Confirm story generation works after adding environment variables
2. **Test Full User Flow** - Create account, generate stories, check library
3. **Performance Optimization** - Address bundle size warnings (922KB main bundle)
4. **Error Handling** - Improve user-facing error messages
5. **Mobile Testing** - Verify responsive design on actual devices

## üìä Technical Debt to Address

1. **Bundle Size** - Main JS bundle is 922KB (should be < 500KB)
   - Implement code splitting
   - Lazy load components
   - Optimize dependencies

2. **Multiple App Files** - Clean up redundant App.jsx variants
   - Keep only App.complete.jsx
   - Remove test versions

3. **StarRewardsSystem** - Component not fully implemented
   - Complete implementation or remove references

## üîê Security Notes

- API keys must be added to Netlify environment variables (never commit to code)
- CSP has been updated to allow necessary third-party services
- Mock generator only runs on localhost (not in production)

## üìç Current State

- **Repository:** Fully synced and up to date
- **Latest Commit:** e8b3dee (CSP fixes and env check)
- **Production Deploy:** https://www.kidsstorytime.ai
- **Netlify Site ID:** 05b2d932-8a96-4c41-9182-54613cb579b4
- **All Changes Pushed:** Yes ‚úÖ

## Session End Time: January 6, 2025
**Ready for Next Session:** After adding environment variables to Netlify
